# SVIP2

Built on NextJS + NetlifyCMS.

## Getting started

- Install [Node and npm (or yarn)](//nodejs.org/).
- Clone repo && run `npm install`.
- To run locally, run `npm run dev`.

NetlifyCMS is entirely controlled by `public/admin/config.yml`. More info at [NetlifyCMS.org](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/configuration-options/).
NextJS docs can be found at [ZEIT.co](https://zeit.co/nextjs).

Backendless - use Netlify Functions (Node/Go) or AWS Lambda for strictly server-side logic (not needed for website, needed for application process).
